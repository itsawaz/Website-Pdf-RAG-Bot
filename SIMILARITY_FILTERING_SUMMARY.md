## RAG Chatbot - Similarity Filtering Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

The RAG chatbot has been enhanced with intelligent similarity-based filtering to prevent hallucination and provide more accurate responses when no relevant information is available.

### üîß Key Changes Made

#### 1. **Enhanced retrieve_context() Method** (main.py:185-213)
- Added similarity threshold filtering using cosine distance
- Convert ChromaDB distances to similarity scores: `similarity = 1 - (distance / 2)`
- Only return documents with similarity >= threshold (default 0.3)
- Added optional debug mode to show similarity scores

#### 2. **Improved chat() Method** (main.py:215-285)
- Better error message when no relevant documents found
- Uses configurable similarity threshold from environment variables
- Clear messaging: "No related information found in the knowledge base"

#### 3. **Configuration Options** (.env file)
```env
# Smart Filtering Configuration
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.3    # Range: 0.0-1.0 (0.3 = balanced, 0.2 = permissive, 0.5 = strict)
DEBUG_SIMILARITY=false     # Set to 'true' to see similarity scores in logs
```

#### 4. **New CLI Debug Command**
- `/debug <query>` - Shows similarity scores for any query
- Helps users understand why certain queries return "no related info"
- Useful for tuning the similarity threshold

#### 5. **Updated AI Prompt** (main.py:225-240)
- More explicit instructions about handling insufficient information
- Clearer guidelines about not making assumptions
- Better citation requirements

### üß™ Testing Results

The test script demonstrates that the system now properly handles queries with no relevant matches:

```
ü§î Query: 'What is quantum computing in artificial intelligence?'
ü§ñ Response: ‚ùå No related information found in the knowledge base. 
             The query doesn't match any content in the uploaded documents.
   ‚úÖ Properly handled - indicated no relevant information found
```

### üéØ Benefits

1. **Prevents Hallucination**: No more made-up answers when information isn't available
2. **Transparency**: Users know when the system has relevant information vs when it doesn't
3. **Configurability**: Adjustable similarity threshold for different use cases
4. **Debugging**: Debug mode helps tune the system for optimal performance
5. **User Guidance**: Helpful suggestions to rephrase questions or add more documents

### üìä How Similarity Filtering Works

1. **Query Processing**: User query is converted to embedding vector
2. **Document Retrieval**: ChromaDB returns top-k most similar documents with distance scores
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Distance converted to similarity score (0.0 = no similarity, 1.0 = identical)
4. **Threshold Filtering**: Only documents with similarity >= threshold are used
5. **Response Generation**: 
   - If relevant docs found ‚Üí Generate answer using those docs
   - If no docs meet threshold ‚Üí Return "no related information" message

### üîß Tuning Guidelines

- **SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.2**: More permissive, may include tangentially related content
- **SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.3**: Balanced (default), good for most use cases  
- **SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.4**: Stricter, only highly relevant content
- **SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.5**: Very strict, may filter too much

Use `/debug <query>` command to see actual similarity scores and tune accordingly.

### üöÄ Usage Examples

**Before Enhancement:**
- Query: "How to bake a cake?" (on a business document database)
- Response: *Hallucinated answer about baking*

**After Enhancement:**
- Query: "How to bake a cake?" (on a business document database)  
- Response: "‚ùå No related information found in the knowledge base. The query doesn't match any content in the uploaded documents."

This prevents the AI from making up information that's not in your documents!
